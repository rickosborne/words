# words

This repo contains a number of word lists compiled by me, Rick Osborne.

Each word list has its own sourcing and licensing information in its `README.md`.
Note that many word lists here are not licensed for commercial use, and some are not licensed for any use!

A really awful web UI for generating random word combinations is available at [https://words.supply](https://words.supply).
